# LAB 5: AUTO DEVOPS WITH A PREDEFINED PROJECT TEMPLATE

We will use a pre-defined template for NodeJS Express to show how Auto DevOps works.

Resource: [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) docs

## Create a new Node JS Express project with Auto DevOps

1.  Just like with previous labs, navigate to your group and click **New project**. Click **Create** from template and then click **Use template** next to **NodeJS Express**.
2.  In the **Project name** field, enter `Auto DevOps-test`. Make sure the **Visiblity Level** is **Private**. Click **Create project**.
3.  Auto DevOps is an alternative to crafting your own `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Note the banner at the top of the window alerting us that Auto DevOps is running in the background.
4.  In the left pane, click **Pipelines** in the **CI/CD** section. Note there are no pipelines running. The most common way to run a pipeline is simply to make a commit to any branch of your project's repository, so let's do that next.
5.  In the left pane, click **Branches** in the **Repository** section. Click the green **New branch** button.
6.  In the **Branch name** field, enter `new-feature`. Click **Create branch**.
7.  In the left pane, click **Pipelines** in the **CI/CD** section. Note that there is now a pipeline running, and that it has the **Auto DevOps** label.
8.  Click **running** and note the 6 stages that Auto DevOps has created.

## Commit a change in order to trigger a pipeline run

1.  In the left pane, click **Repository**.
2.  Switch to the **new-feature** branch by selecting it in the dropdown that currently says **master** near the top left of the window.
3.  To edit a file on this branch, click **Web IDE** near the top right of the window.
4.  Click `views` \> `index.pug`.
5.  Click the blue **Edit** button and then modify the last line of `index.pug` to: `p GitLab welcomes you to #{title}` Note: be sure to include the `p` at the beginning of the line.
6.  In the **Commit message** field, type update welcome message in `index.pug`. Click **Commit changes**.
7.  Click the blue **Create merge request** button.
8.  Assign the merge request to yourself.
9.  Add `Draft`:to the beginning of the text in the **Title** field to show that it isn't ready to be merged yet.
10. Leave all other fields at their default values and click **Submit merge request** at the bottom of the page. You now have an active merge request for merging the `new-feature` branch into the `master` branch. The page you are on shows the details of that merge request, including the status of the last pipeline that was run on the `new-feature` branch (sometimes you have to refresh the page to see the pipeline's status). GitLab will run a new pipeline every time you commit to the `new-feature` branch.
11. Toward the end of the Auto DevOps pipeline, it will deploy your NodeJS Express application into a review environment named after the branch: **review**/**new-feature**.
12. You can see the Docker container that the Auto DevOps pipeline created when it was deploying your application to the review environment: in the left pane, click **Container Registry** in the **Packages & Registries** section.
