# LAB 1: CREATE A PROJECT AND ISSUE
## Create a project

 1. Navigate to **Groups** > **Your groups** in the top navigation bar.
2.  Expand the arrow to the left of **Training Users**. Expand the arrow to the left of the **Session** entry for your class. Click on the entry for **My Test Group** that includes your username (hint: the group with the `Owner` tag is yours).
3.  Click the blue **New project** button. Click **Create blank project**.
4.  In the **Project name** field, enter `Top Level Project`. Optionally, include a few notes in the **Project description** box.
5.  Under **Visibility Level**, click the radio button for **Private**.
6.  Click the **Initialize repository with a README** checkbox. If you don't initialize your repository with a README, you will create a “bare” Git repository that you will need to add content to in order to bring into existence.
7. Click the green **Create project** button.

## Create an issue

 1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Issues** section on the taskbar. You might need to click the double right-arrow icon at the bottom of the taskbar to make the section names visible.
2.  Click the blue **New issue** button.
3.  In the **Title** field, type `my first issue`. Optionally, enter a comment in the **Description** field.
4.  In the **Assignees** field, click the **Assign to me** link.
5.  Leave all other fields at their defaults and click **Submit issue**.

## Create custom labels

 1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Labels** section (under the **Issues** header) on the taskbar.
2.  Click the blue **New label** button.
3.  In the **Title** field, type `Opened` and assign it a background color of your choosing.
4.  Click the blue **Create label** button. Note: this label has been created at the project level, so it is specific to that project. It will not be available at the group level. 
6.  Using the same steps, create labels for `Completed` and `Needs documentation`, using label colors of your choice. 

You should now have 3 labels created under the **Labels** section of the taskbar.

## Utilize a quick action

 1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Issues** section on the taskbar.
2.  Click on **my first issue** to open it.
3.  Below the comment field, click the **quick actions** link.
4.  Review the various quick actions you can complete by using the comment field in an issue.
5.  Navigate back to the GitLab page for **my first issue**.
6.  In the text editor field in the comment section, type `/spend 1 h`
7.  Click the green **Comment** button.
8.  Notice that in the right-hand pane, the time tracking widget reflects your last action.

## Assign labels to an issue

 1. Find the **Labels** section in the right-hand pane of the `my first issue` page. Click **Edit** in that section.
2.  Click on the `Opened` and `Needs documentation` labels you created earlier.
3.  Click away from the **Labels** section, and notice that the issue has both labels applied to it.
