1- **Group**
Groups are a top level organization method. Other programs might refer to it as Projects.

With GitLab groups, you can:
* Assemble related projects together.
* grant members access to several projects at once.

2- **Sub Groups**
Subgroups, also known as nested groups or hierarchical groups, allow you to have up to 20 levels of groups.
By using subgroups you can do the following:
* Separate internal/external organisations. since every group can have its own visibility level, you are able to host groups for different purposes under the same umbrella. 
* Organize large projects. for large projects, subgroups make it potentially easier to separate permissions on parts of the source code.
* Make it easier to manage people and control visibility. Give people different permissions depending on their membership.

3- **Projects**
In Gitlab, you can create projects for hosting your codebase, use it as an issue tracker, collaborater on code, and continuously build, test, and deploy your app with built-in Gitlab CI/CD.

Your projects can be available publicly, internally, or privately, at your choice. Gitlab does not limit the number of private projects your create. 

4- **Issues**
Issues are always associated with a specific project, but if you have multiple projects in a group, you can also view all the issues collectively at the group level.
Common use cases include:
* Discussing the implementation of a new idea
* Tracking task and work status
* Accepting feature proposals, questions, support requests, or bug reports
* Elaborating on new code implementations

5- **Issue Features** 
Once you create an issue you can add participants and communicate with them using Comments. You can also assign participants to the issue to help track who is responsible for what.

### GitLab Epics

Epics let you manage your portfolio of projects more efficiently and with less effort by tracking groups of issues that share a theme, across projects and milestones.

Epics allow you to group related issues and epics together. This is useful if you want better visibility of related issues. For example, you might want to see all of the issues in a project in a roadmap and generate a Gantt chart for your program or portfolio.
