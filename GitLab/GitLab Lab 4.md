# LAB 4: BUILD A `.gitlab-ci.yml` FILE

## Create a new project and add a CI/CD configuration file

1.  Navigate to your group, click **New project**, click **Create blank project**.
2.  In the Project name dialog box, enter `CI Test`.
3.  Under **Visibility Level**, click the radio button for **Private**.
4.  Enable the checkbox for **Initialize repository with a README**.
5.  Click the green **Create project** button.
6.  You should be on the **Project overview** page for your `CI Test` project. If not, navigate to it using the top navigation bar: **Groups** \> **Your Groups** \> **Training Users** \> **Session NUMBER** \> **My Test Group** \- **USERNAME** \> **CI Test**.
7.  Create a new file by clicking the **+** dropdown 2 lines below the project's title. Click **New file** in the **This directory** section.
8.  In the **File name** dialog box enter `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
9.  If it's not already selected, click **.gitlab-ci.yml** in the next dropdown to the right, which selects a file template.
10. In the **Apply a template** dropdown, select **Bash** in the **General** section. This creates a minimal `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
11. In the editor, delete all lines above and below the **build1** and **test1** sections
12. Define **build** and **test** stages by adding these 3 lines at the top of the file. Hint: watch your spacing! The `stages` keyword should be flush left. The stage names should each be indented by 2 spaces.

> **stages**:
> \- `build`
> \- `test`

13. Click the green **Commit changes** button.

## Inspect the CI/CI pipeline

1.  GitLab started running a CI/CD pipeline as soon as you committed `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your project's repository. To see the project's pipelines, go to the left navigation bar and click **CI/CD** \> **Pipelines**.
2.  Only one pipeline has run so far. See the details of that pipeline by clicking the green **passed** label next to the pipeline's table entry.
3.  In the **Build** column, there's a widget representing the **build1** job that belongs to that stage. In the **Test** column there's a widget representing the **test1** job that belongs to that stage.
4.  Click the **build1** widget to see a web terminal that shows what happened when that job ran.
5.  Go back and do the same for the **test1** widget.
