__Linux Upskill Challange__ is a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/) (r/linuxupskillchallenge) that helps new people learning Linux by monthly daily lesson. 

It's quite a good start for all those who want to get their feet wet in learnig _Linux_ and _Sysadmin_ and _Networking_ stuffs for their career or own interest. 

I thoughts it's great to keep these resources in one place for future reference and for those who are looking for beginner guide/resources onlines.
