Introduction

> Many people speak of “**freedom**” with regard to **Linux**, but I don't think most people
know what this freedom really means. Freedom is the ***power to decide what your computer does***, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

## Why Use the Command Line?
- Most computer users today are familiar only with the graphical user interface (GUI) and have been taught by vendors and pundits that the command line interface (CLI) is a terrifying thing of the past.
- This is unfortunate, because a good command line interface is a marvellously expressive way of communicating with a computer in much the same way the written word is for human beings.
- It's been said that “***graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy***, while ***command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible***” and this is still very true today.
